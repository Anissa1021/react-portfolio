                    <p>Hello I am Anissa Aracena and I am currently trying my best at web developent. I always try my best to find time to learn as much as I can and to try out different methods, and it can get pretty overwhelming at times with all of the information that I am absorbing. However I will continue trying my best to improve and learn as much as I can, as well as helping my team out when we have projects going. I enjoy working on front end and back end, although I do struggle with JavaScript but I can see myself imporving the more I go. Over the last couple of months I see how much I've grown and improved since my first assignment, so I am proud of myself and my classmates who have made it far.</p>

                    <p>A little about me, I enjoy dance as a hobby. I enjoy coffee very VERY much and I can talk about my cat all day with pictures and videos included. I lived in Oregon for a while but eventually moved back to Washington, both are very nice and was a great experience. </p>
